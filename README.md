# Dicee-Anime-Roll-Game

Welcome to the **Dicee Anime Roll Game** â€” a modern, soft pastel-themed dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is inspired by the Dicee mini-game created during the Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu. However, the visual styling, layout, and interactivity were redesigned entirely to reflect a custom aesthetic.
